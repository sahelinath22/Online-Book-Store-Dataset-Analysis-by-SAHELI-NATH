📚 Online Book Store Data Analysis (PostgreSQL)


📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing data analysis for an Online Book Store using PostgreSQL.

The objective of this project is to extract meaningful business insights about books, customers, and orders through various SQL queries — covering both basic and advanced analysis.

This assignment demonstrates practical SQL skills, such as table creation, data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, joining, and revenue analysis for a retail dataset.



🧩 Dataset Structure

The project uses three interrelated datasets stored in PostgreSQL tables:

Table Name	Description

Books	Contains information about all available books such as title, author, genre, price, stock, etc.

Customers	Contains customer details like name, contact info, and location.

Orders	Records customer orders with details like order date, quantity, and total amount.

Books Table

Column	Description
Book_ID	Unique ID for each book
Title	Title of the book
Author	Name of the author
Genre	Category/genre of the book
Published_Year	Year when the book was published
Price	Selling price of the book
Stock	Available stock quantity


Customers Table

Column	Description
Customer_ID	Unique ID for each customer
Name	Customer’s full name
Email	Customer’s email address
Phone	Contact number
City	Customer’s city
Country	Customer’s country


Orders Table

Column	Description
Order_ID	Unique order identifier
Customer_ID	Foreign key referencing Customers table
Book_ID	Foreign key referencing Books table
Order_Date	Date of the order
Quantity	Number of books ordered
Total_Amount	Total order value


🧠 Objectives

1) Create and manage a relational database for an Online Book Store.

2) Analyze key metrics such as revenue, sales, and customer behavior.

3) Use SQL joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and grouping to generate insights.

4) Apply data exploration techniques for different analytical perspectives.



🧾 SQL File Description


File Name: ONLINE BOOK STORE DATA ANALYSIS BY SAHELI NATH.sql

This file includes:

Database and Table Creation – Defining schema for Books, Customers, and Orders.

Data Retrieval Queries – Using SELECT, WHERE, and DISTINCT for data exploration.

Aggregate Functions – Using SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), and ORDER BY for analytics.

Join Operations – Combining tables to correlate books, customers, and orders.

Business Analysis Queries – Advanced insights like best-selling books, customer segmentation, and revenue tracking.



📊 Key Insights Derived


✅Total stock of all available books in the store.

✅Top 3 most expensive books in the Fantasy genre.

✅Most frequently ordered book across all customers.

✅Customers who placed multiple orders or spent the most.

✅Genre-wise total books sold and author-wise total quantity sold.

✅Total revenue generated by the store.

✅Cities with customers spending over $30.

✅Remaining stock after fulfilling all orders.



🧰 Tools & Technologies Used


👉🏻PostgreSQL – For database creation and analysis

👉🏻SQL – For querying and deriving insights

👉🏻Excel Files – Used as the source data (Books, Customers, and Orders)

👉🏻pgAdmin – For executing SQL scripts and visualizing outputs
